## Overview
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Select and submit a number rating
-   See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   jQuery

### What I learned

I realized today how far I've come since the beginning of the month, when I didn't even know what HTML was. I finally figured out mundane things like centering objects and started getting familiar with JQuery and Javascript.

### Continued development

I will definitely want to continue to refine data manipulation by interacting with inputs and buttons. Any suggestions are welcome.
